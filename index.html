                <p>Hey there! I'm Savannah, and I'm a software engineer living in Seattle, WA. I majored in
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomatics">geomatics</a> at the University of
                    Waterloo up in Canada. Although you've likely never heard of geomatics, let me assure you - it's
                    the best possible combination of computer science and technical geography.
                    In the past, I've worked at some pretty awesome companies (if I do say so myself). You can read more
                    about that on my <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>

                <p>In my free time, I like to go hiking in the mountains, do hot yoga, go running, cook things like
                    Okonomiyaki, ramen made from scratch or a roast chicken dinner with all the fixings on a Tuesday
                    night, and travel as far and as much as I can with my husband (sometimes I even blog about it
                    on <a href="http://www.theperpetualtravellers.com"> The Perpetual Travellers</a>).</p>

                <p>If you like meeting other humans, find me somewhere on the Internet. I'd love to meet you!
